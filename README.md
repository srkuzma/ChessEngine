# ChessEngine

Chess app with the option of playing against computer. Engine was built using backtracking, with the implementation of minimax algorithm and alpha-beta prunning.
There are options of:
- premoving pieces
- navigating through move history (by clicking on a certain move or with left/right arrow keys)
- checking available squares for certain piece
- changing the color of the board
- starting a new game
Side bar contains timers for both players, as well as the move history menu and taken pieces by the human player and the computer (sorted by piece value)
